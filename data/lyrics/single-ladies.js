const lyrics = `gettin' bodied
(If you ready, get it ready) gettin' bodied
(Let's get it and drop it) hey
Give it up for my sister!
All right now
Everybody put your hands together
Do we have any single ladies in the house tonight?
sing
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up
Up in the club (club)
Just broke up (up)
I'm doing my own little thing
You decided to dip (dip)
But now you wanna trip (trip)
'Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him (him)
He up on me (me)
Don't pay him any attention
I cried my tears (tears)
For three good years (years)
You can't be mad at me
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (whoa, oh, oh)
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Now wait
I want y'all to get nice and stanky with me
Where I'm from
We do things nice and stanky
We do things nice and funky (alright y'all)
Can y'all repeat after me
You ready? Say
Hey-ay (hey-ay)
Hey ay-ay (hey ay-ay)
Hey-ay (hey-ay)
Hey ay-ay (hey ay-ay)
Hey-ay (hey-ay)
Hey ay-ay (hey ay-ay)
Hey-ay-yeah (hey-ay-yeah)
Hey-ay-ay (hey-ay-ay)
Now wait
You still ain't stankin' enough for me
Say whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Sing) whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (put your hands up)
Say whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Where my ring at?)
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Sing (whoa, oh, oh)
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it (I see you)
If you like it, then you shoulda put a (ring on it)
(Whoa, oh, oh, oh) if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
(Whoa, oh, oh, oh) hey
I love y'all
